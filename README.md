# Hackintosh-Config-Lenovo-IdeaPad-3I_10110U

**Remembering that the intention is to help and not steal someone elseâ€™s project!! All credits go to the original author.**

This configuration was adapted for the Lenovo Ideapad 3I with the 10100U processor so that some things work well.

Things that work with the original author's default configuration:

  - Webcam (Lenovo UVC Camera)
  - Touchpad (ELAN I2C)
  - HDMI (Audio + Video)
  - Brightness Control (F11/F12 Keys)
<br/><br/>

Things that work in my setup:

  - CPU (Intel Core i3-10110U)
  - Audio (Realtek ALC257)
  - USB (Comet Lake PCH-LP USB 3.1)
  - Sleep
<br/><br/>
 
CPU (Intel Core i3-10110U)
<br/>*Now power management works perfectly, even allowing the user to see the CPU temperature*<br/>

Audio (Realtek ALC257)
<br/>*Only the layout-id was corrected*<br/>

USB (Comet Lake PCH-LP USB 3.1)
<br/>*It worked in the default configuration, however, it caused problems with sleep*<br/>

Sleep
<br/>*Now works perfectly*<br/>
